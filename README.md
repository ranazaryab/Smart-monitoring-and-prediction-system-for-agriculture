# Smart-monitoring-and-prediction-system-for-agriculture
This is an IOT based project which takes input from the environment with the help of sensors and send that input to our arduino board then using that input the system predicts which crop will be best for that particular land and also with the help of the system we can monitor the land from anywhere.
